        <p>Daemen focusses a lot on cyber security, bringing affordable fiberglass internet connections, effeciency and
            effectiveness of their employees.
            They want their employees to feel comfortable at work, that way they will work more effeciently.</p>
        <p>After hearing this it sounded quite interesting since having a nice and comfortable workplace will help a lot
            with enjoying your job for many years.
            Cybersecurity seems interesting aswell but I am not sure if this is where my main interest is perhaps I'll
            enjoy it more after a while.
            I do like that they try to bring affordable fiberglass internet to NL which makes internet a lot faster.</p>
